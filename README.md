# Scan & Go
Android application (Kotlin) that will showcase whether it is possible or not to use your own mobile phone to scan items in the supermarket and have an easy checkout at the cash register.

**Concept**
A lot of supermarkets offer the possibility of self-scanning. With the use of hand-scanners, they can scan their items as they stroll through the store and have a quick-and-easy checkout at the cash register. 

A lot of people touch these hand-scanners throughout the day and with the on-going pandemic it could lead to infections. To prevent these - unnecessary - infections it could be a solution for customers to scan their items with their own phone. 

The POC Android application will showcase whether it is possible or not to use your own mobile phone to scan items in the supermarket and have an easy checkout at the cash register.
